# US Pack Logistics Technical Assignment

This project is a simple demo of a Node.js Express backend combined with a 
Vue.js frontend

## Running the Project

Running these two applications requires that Node.js is installed. I tested 
these applications using Node.js 15. Both components of the project can be 
started using the following shell commands in their respective folders.

**frontend**
```shell
npm install && npm run serve
```

**backend**
```shell
npm install && npm run start
```

This will make the frontend application accessible at `localhost:8080` and the backend endpoint accessible at `localhost:8081/orders`.
